# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Senior Go Developer** with 5+ years in fintech and performance engineering, passionate about building scalable systems that donâ€™t buckle under pressure. Iâ€™ve led backend teams, optimized payment platforms, and sprinkled some AI magicâ€”including LLMsâ€”into profiling and tracing tools.
